# Introduction

Hello. My name is David. I am new to programming and will be using this repository to share my first steps into programming. My main language is python. MY goals for the future are to get into Data Analytics and eventually Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence research. I would love any feed back on my code. Mainly how I can improve it and if I make any newbie mistakes in structure or efficency. I look forward to hearing from you and build connections with other programmers. In the future I will be putting bigger projects on to GitHub and would love advice on them as well.
